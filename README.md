# Rayleigh-Scattering-Visualization
A personnal project aiming to create a simulation of the Rayleigh scattering, phenomenon responsible for the blue color of the sky. After an end year project at University, trying to experimentaly reproduce the Rayleigh effect using a solution Sodium Thiosulfate, I wanted to go a bit further and create a computer simulation of that effect. The first part of this project consist of the creation of an envionment where the physics equations will then be applied in a second party. 

# Progress and update
As mentioned earlier, this is a personnal project. Therefore the update frequency might be inconsistent. Considering the difficulty of this implementation, I decided to fragment my study into different steps to better handle this challenge. Moreover, I am currently doing my Master Degree in Fundamental Physics. That is to say: I do not focus actively on this project, I work on it whenever I feel like it, or if I can allocate some time to this program.

# External help
If you wish to send your own version of your code, or suggestions: please do so. I'm looking for more point of views, ideas and criticism. I consider this visualization as a high level project for my level at the moment. Maybe time will allow me to be more efficient.
